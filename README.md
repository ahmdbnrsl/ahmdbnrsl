Hello, my name is Ahmad Beni Rusli. I was born in Cilacap on July 23, 2005. Currently, I live in Rt03 RW 05 Tinggarjaya village, Sidareja subdistrict, Cilacap district.

Since I was a child, I have had a great interest in the world of art and technology. This can be seen from my hobbies of painting and coding.

For me, painting is a way to express myself and pour out my creativity. While coding, I consider it an art to build something useful and that can help many people.

My interest in art and technology has led me to my dream of becoming a Fullstack Web Developer. I want to combine my skills in design art and programming to create beautiful and functional websites.

I am confident that with hard work and dedication, I can achieve my goals and become a successful Fullstack Web Developer.

Thank you for your attention.
